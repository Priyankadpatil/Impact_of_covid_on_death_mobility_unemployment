# Visualization of Impacts of Covid-19 on Deaths, Mobility and Unemployment in the US

- Mobility data
- unemployment rate during covid-19.

## Below are some of the key findings :

- Analyzing the Time Series of deaths, the Most affected state is 'New York' followed by 'Texas' and 'California'

- On finding Correlation on the most affected state, we could find that deaths are strongly correlated with population, a state with the higher population is more likely to have impacted with higher deaths.

- Analyzing Mobility data, We found that there is a strong Positive Correlation between most of the mobility variables i,e Grocery & Pharmacy, Transit stations, Retail & Recreation, Workplaces, Parks although there was a negative correlation on Residential area.

- Analyzing Unemployment data, we can see that the unemployment rate in the nation had a very direct correlation with the number of deaths happening in the country, from this we can confirm the reason for the drastically greater unemployment rate was most likely covid-19.
